## Unit 01: Excel
#### What's the relevance of Excel?
- Many companies still use Excel in their day to day operations and expect new employees to be comfortable with the software. 
- We want everyone to start off on the same footing, later in class we will be diving even deeper into data software. VBA will be starting next week, and having a good foundation in Excel will make it easier for everyone.
---
## Unit 02: VBA Scripting
#### What's the relevance of VBA?
- This is an introduction into the basics of programming that will be relevant later in the course, and also a great way to automate the data manipulation that we do in excel.
- This software is prevalent in many older companies and in the financial industry. Many companies will want you to be able to manipulate Excel with VBA.

## Unit 03: Python
#### What's up with this crazy indentation?
- With Python, indentation is more than just organization and readability. Python's functionality actually depends on proper indentation!
- In this snippet, we're using indentation to tell our code where our for loops begin and end. In Python, indenting creates blocks of code that work together. Similarly, indenting backwards tells the program when to end a loop.
```python
for x in range(10):
    print(x)

for x in range(20, 30):
    print(x)
```
- The code you will write in Python will be seen by someone else. Focusing on organization is important because you want colleagues to be able to read your code. If the code is poorly organized it will be difficult to read later on.

## Unit 04: Pandas
#### When should we use Pandas versus just using Python?
- Python is a scripting language, while Pandas is a library that works on top of Python and makes data manipulation easier.
-  Libraries are pre-written chunks of code that make it easier to unlock the capabilities of a programming language. Someone else already did a ton of hard work to create these libraries and make your lives easier and your workflow more efficient.
- It would be a slog to manually go through all of your data with vanilla Python. Pandas makes this process much quicker.
- It's like using Excel vs using VBA with Excel.
---
## Unit 05: Matplotlib
#### I'm having trouble picking up on this new syntax...
- Luckily, there is a library for that! Whenever we work with a library, we are using code that is already pre-written. We always need to reference the documentation when using a new library. Without looking at the instructions, you will never know how to use this piece of technology. 
- We recognize this may be your first time looking at a library that is less semantic, but this will be a constant for the future. You will see a lot of new technology throughout the course, and each time you will need to dive into the documentation. The docs will be different for each new technology.
#### Why do we have.plt() sometimes and other times not? 
- We have a couple of different plotting methods available to use in Matplotlib.

## Unit 06: Python APIs
#### How do I differentiate between the client and the server? 
- The web applications we build in class (and all other web apps) will live on a server, which is basically a gigantic computer or network of computers. When a user goes into their browser and types in an address, the server sends information to the user's computer, or the client.
- Basically: Clients request from the server, and the server returns a response. 

#### Where can I find more information on how to use these APIs?
- Each API is a pre-written set of code that helps you interact with somebody elses information. Every API will come with its own set of documentation, and much like with a library, you will have to dive into it! There should be a developer section on each site that will explain the service and any potential limitations.
- Any time we work with an API, it's a good idea to have the documentation ready and refer to it frequently. This is all part of the process when it comes to picking up and familiarizing yourself with new technologies.
